# NHLRecaps

This desktop application was built using electron and is very much a work in progress.
Desktop releases will be made availiable once I feel the application has reached
a proper refined state. Until then, it will be your responsibility to install the
necessary dependencies if you want to run/test the application. This project was
chosen because I wanted a central place to view game recaps, condensed games,
and in the future, nhl standings, team/player stats, etc. Furthermore,
I wanted a way to showcase (and gain) experience with Javascript, HTML,
and CSS. 

# Installing the dependencies

To be able to run this experemental application, you will need Electron, which is installed
with npm. Most systems should have npm installed, but if not please refer to google. With
npm installed you need to run `npm install --save-dev electron` INSIDE of the repository
which will create a "node_modules" folder where the electron dependencies will live. Once
installed, run `npm start .` to get the application to run. Enjoy! :D
